# Learning_SeismicData
Here are some notebooks used i implemented learning to work with seismic data
01.Nympy_SintData - some basic excersizes with numpy arrays to get a better understanging of 3D arrays, and how to operate them
02.MapsAnd_SEGY - working with 2D and 3D seismic data (horizons, and 3D SEGY qubes), making some attributes (such as RMS), clusterization, IDW interpolation for wells, and implementing a lot of visuzlization.
03.ML_prognose - using machine learning to implement collector probability prediction


About the data:
Seismic methods are based on the excitation of elastic waves using a technical device or a complex of source devices. The source creates excessive pressure in the rock thickness, which is compensated by the medium for some time. In the process of compensation, bound rock particles make periodic oscillations transmitted deep into the earth by elastic waves. The most important property of a wave is its velocity, which depends on the lithological composition, the state of rocks (fracturing, weathering, etc.), age, and depth of occurrence.

Spreading in the volume of rocks, elastic waves fall on the boundaries of layers with different elastic properties, change the direction, angles of rays and amplitude, and new waves are formed. Reception points are located along the path of the waves, where particle vibrations are received with the help of seismic receivers and converted into an electrical signal.
